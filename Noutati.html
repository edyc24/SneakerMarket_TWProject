                    <p>The adidas Yeezy Boost 350 V2 ‘Onyx’ applies a stealthy palette to the lifestyle silhouette that merges Kanye West’s visionary aesthetic with adidas’ performance technology. The sneaker makes use of a one-note black Primeknit upper, secured with rope laces and equipped with a pull tab at the heel. On the lateral side, a post-dyed monofilament stripe adds a see-through element to the sock-like build. A full-length Boost midsole is surrounded by a ribbed, semi-translucent TPU cage that maintains the shoe’s monochrome design.</p>

                    <p>Covered in an eye-catching “Light Green Spark” color, the latest posthumous offering from Virgil Abloh commemorates the American designer’s “Figures of Speech” exhibition, a multi-media showcase of Abloh’s work that’s been programmed to be hosted by the Brooklyn Museum from July 1st, 2022 until January 29th, 2023. The upcoming sneakers feature identical design elements to past Off-White Air Force 1 styles prepped to commemorate the late Abloh’s retrospective exhibitions at the Museum of Modern Art, Institute of Contemporary Art Boston and Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago. Unlike its predecessors, however, the “Brooklyn” release seemingly won’t require potential customers to be within a specific area to be able to purchase the kicks.</p>
